In this project, I am exploring the question: **"What is the correlation between socioeconomic status and crime rate in the US?"**

To measure the socioeconomic status, I plan on using the Area Deprivation Index, which is the most heavily independently validated metric for measuring US neighborhood-level disadvantage. The ADI takes into account public data relating to income, education, employment, and housing quality to measure the socioeconomic status of communities. More specifically, the ADI ranks neighborhoods against both the nation and the state in which the neighborhood is located within â€” a higher ADI percentage indicates that the given neighborhood is more economically disadvantaged than "X percent" of other regions. In other words, the higher the ADI percentile, the greater the economic disadvantage.

Additionally, keeping socioeconomic status as an overarching topic, I plan on exploring how different factors individually contribute to crime rate in the US.

The demographical factors I will focus on are as follows:
- Median income
- Percentage of population with high school diploma
- Percentage of population with bachelor's degree

Given that BigQuery only provides public datasets on crime for the states of Austin and Chicago, I will using a dataset from the Federal Bureau Investigation for the purposes of this project, with the objective of examining the relationship between crime rate and socioeconomic status by zipcode. I acknowledge that this does not paint a complete picture of the correlation between socioeconomic status and crime rate in the US, but still hope to explore any trends that appear.
